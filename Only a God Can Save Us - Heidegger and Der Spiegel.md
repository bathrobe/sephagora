An [[interview]] with philosopher Martin [[Heidegger]]. He stipulated it had to be published after his death.

I looked this interview up for its relevance to [[Cybernetics Wiki]]-- [[Yuk Hui]] mentions it in his discussion of [[The Computational Turn]]. This is the quote I was looking for, though there wasn't much explanation of it:

> H: "The role of philosophy in the past has been taken ever today by the sciences... Philosophy [today] dissolves into individual sciences: psychology, logic, political science."
> Der Spiegel: "And what now takes the place of philosophy?" 
> H: "Cybernetics."

There are some poetic thoughts about the God from the title quote:

> ...philosophy will be unable to effect any immediate change in the current state of the world. This is true not only of philosophy but of all purely human reflection and endeavor. Only a god can save us. The only possibility available to us is that by thinking and poetizing we prepare a readiness for the appearance of a god...

The interviewer makes mention of a [[Buddhist]] monk Heidegger spoke with, which may have been [[D.T. Suzuki]].

> About two years ago in an exchange with a Buddhist monk, you spoke of "a completely new method of thinking" and said that this new method of thinking is, "at first, possible for but few men to achieve."
