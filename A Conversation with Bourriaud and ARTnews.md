An interview with [[Nicolas Bourriaud]] about [[Altermodernism]], from 2009. They discuss the Altermodern show at the 2009 Tate exhibition, then revisit some of Nicolas Bourriaud's earlier writings.

New ideas I was introduced to: [[creolization]], [[Gustav Metzger]]

Questions: How could physical spaces be made to represent the feeling of surfing the internet? He describes the way his 2009 Tate exhibition was structured as "scattered or fragmented forms, archipelago-like... the impression of a journey." (This reminded me of the world [[map]] available in the [[unnamed culture project]].)

"One critic from a London newspaper wrote that he had the same feeling visiting the show as when browsing on his computer." Neat!

> ‘Altermodern’ is a word that intends to define the specific modernity according to the specific context we live in – globalization, and its economic, political and cultural conditions. The use of the prefix “alter” ... alludes to the local struggles against standardization. The core of this new modernity is, according to me, the experience of wandering — in time, space and mediums. But the definition is far from being complete.

He suggests multiculturalism and identity are being taken over by [[creolization]] and that artists start from a "global state of culture." What does this mean?

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creolization): Originally particular to the Caribbean and linguists, "scholars in other social sciences use the term [creolization] to describe new cultural expressions brought about by contact between societies and relocated peoples."

It seems the crucial point here is that creolization is not solely the mixing of native cultures in a person, but a mixing in people who have _already_ experienced their culture relocated, and now are further remixed in their new home.

> With globalization, creolization has undergone a "remapping of worlds regions" or as Orlando Patterson would explain, "the creation of wholly new cultural forms in the transnational space, such as 'New Yorican' and Miami Spanish".

Bourriaud says, "We have to get out of this dialectical loop between the global and the local, to get rid of the binary opposition between globalization and traditions...

...the fact that you are born here or there does not necessarily determine your frame of mind anymore."

[[Gustav Metzger]] is the father figure of the Altermodern.

He's a 60s artist known for destructivist art. From Gustav Metzger - Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Metzger

> When Metzger was lecturing at Ealing Art College, one of his students was rock musician Pete Townshend, who later cited Metzger's concepts as an influence for his famous guitar-smashing during performances of The Who. He has also influenced the self-eating computer virus works by the digital artist Joseph Nechvatal.

Auto-destructive art - Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto-destructive_art and Art Strike - Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Strike are Metzger's core movements.
