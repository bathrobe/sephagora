The response to COVID has caused a deluge of sanitizer chemicals and products being dumped into the ecosystem. It's an environmental disaster and another example of the need for [[systems-level solutions]].

> The astronomical rise in sanitization and protection practices is entirely warranted. But COVID-19 also requires us to put these practices under the microscope, so that we can better understand the hazards and trade-offs that come with realizing our vision of living in ultra-hygienic environments.

> The global liquid detergent market is expected to grow by nearly $10 billion to almost $40 billion by 2025. In Egypt, for example, the Ministry of Public Business Sector published data showing that demand for sodium hypochlorite (which is used to manufacture bleaches and disinfectants) had increased by 800% by the start of May.

> First, governments must coordinate efforts to prioritize domestic wastewater treatment systems to cope with the surge in chemicals and solid waste, including investment in contemporary large-scale treatment plants or decentralized systems and all-important medical waste collection and disposal systems â€” even outside of hospitals.

> For developing countries in a post-pandemic world, investment in the essential infrastructure of wastewater management must be dramatically increased.
