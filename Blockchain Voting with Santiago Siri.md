Article in [[WIRED]] about [[Santiago Siri]]'s experiments with [[Blockchain]] democracy.

Summary: [[Santiago Siri]] has made a blockchain voting platform called [[DemocracyEarth]]. Its goal is to "tokenize the like," ie to use social media's toolkit to dispense money and/or achieve democracy via cryptocurrency. A problem with this approach is the token is monetized, which complicates open governance, and the onus is on Siri to prove his tools help more than they hurt.

> Siri dreams of a new kind of social media platform on which we spend “vote tokens” that can do anything, from electing politicians and passing referendums to enacting the bylaws of a social club or establishing the business plan of a corporation. It’s democracy by click.

[[DemocracyEarth]] has a [white paper](https://www.dropbox.com/s/f5zzofunx186dcu/The%20Social%20Smart%20Contract.pdf?dl=0).

In code, a tool can easily be repurposed from its original context-- removed from its first ontology-- and blockchain seems this way. "Money" = "vote" like "product for sale" = "Wordpress blog post." It's just the structure being hacked. But it still sounds bad to make blockchain = money. How can a blockchain structure not be worth money?
