An article by [[Nathan Gardels]], editor of [[NOEMA]].  

The [[Noopolitik]]--a structure of power defined by interdependent nodes in a global mind--  is an alternative to the Realpolitik that has defined power for centuries.   

Quotes:  

> Inexorably, a kind of global mind, or “noosphere” as Teilhard de Chardin envisioned it, is emerging. But it is today as much a terrain of contestation rooted in divergent political and cultural tempers, including an ever more differentiating splinternet, as a space of common ground.  

> The “noopolitik” of the coming era could not be more different than the realpolitik of the last century. Rather than solid nation-states in which elites calculate balances of power, noopolitik is a transparent endeavor open to all manner of connected players in a now gaseous global realm in which nations are attempting to reclaim sovereignty even as the solidity they once assumed diminishes with every passing day.  

There's this phases-of-matter kind of analogy in the above that's intriguing. The mind is a gas, the nation is solid. Corona is airborne, gaseous. Climate is porous. What's most massive is least dense. "The Cloud."  


Solid | Gas
------ | ------
Nation-States  | Global networks  
Hard Power   | "Soft"/Media Power  
Traditional InfoTech   | "Cloud computing"
