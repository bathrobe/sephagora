A [[guide]] by professor [[Joel Chan]] on doing procedural research, with the aim of creating new ideas.

The summary of his workflow:

1. Form research question notes. Flesh them out into specific, researchable questions.
2. Create observation notes from sources. These should try rephrasing the sources as well as quoting them. Should culminate in a couple blocks of cited facts.
3. Create synthesis notes. These begin to **answer the question.** They pull in observation notes from the sources and form original thoughts. Iterative with other phases-- go back to the prior two steps and refine their products.
4. Compose synthesis notes into arguments, theories, articles. These often point to new, better research questions. See weaknesses in preceding areas and refine. When done, can append to the original question note, or create super-synthesis notes out of other questions.
